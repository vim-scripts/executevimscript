This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2066

This package allows you to:
- Execute some selected vimscript lines
- Create a vimscript sandbox where you can type & test vimscript fast

This is a very rough version, with no checks. It currently works only on lines, but in later versions hopefully it will work with any selection, including rectangular selection.

The goal of this package is to provide a Vim equivalent of Smalltalk&#039s \"do it\" and \"print it\".
